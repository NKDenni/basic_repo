Once I created the repository on GitHub I created a directory on my local machine.
 - cd to the parent directory
 - mkdir basic_repo
 Then I initalized the git repostory on my local machine. And began to work in it.
 - git init
 - git remote add origin https://github.com/NKDenni/basic_repo.git
 - git add 
    (added files to the staging area of the local repository)
 - git commit -m "First commit"
 - git push
 - git status (to confirm that the status of my files were in fact uploaded to the remote repository.)
 Continued work on local files and made some changes.
 - git add
 - git commit -m "added html file"
 - git push 
    (staged and pushed to the remote repository on github updates and new files)
